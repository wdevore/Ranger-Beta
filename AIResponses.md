# i have an 8x8 grid of squares

and each needs to displace from each other by 0.025 and all squares must fit within an area that is 1 unit by 1 unit. what is the displacement of each square along either the X axis or Y axis. This means there should be 16 squares in each quadrant but displaced from each other.

Okay, let's break down how to find the displacement for your 8x8 grid of squares within a 1x1 unit area, with a `0.025` (<mark>d</mark>) unit gap between each square.

## 1. Understanding the Setup

- You have an 8x8 grid, meaning 8 squares along the X-axis and 8 squares along the Y-axis.
- These 64 squares must fit into a total area of 1 unit by 1 unit.
- There's a gap of `0.025` units between adjacent squares (not between squares and the edge of the 1x1 area).

## 2. Calculating the Side Length of a Single Square (s)

Along one dimension (say, the X-axis), you have 8 squares and 7 gaps between them. The total length occupied by these squares and gaps must be 1 unit.

So, the equation is: `8 * s + 7 * d = 1` where <mark>s</mark> is the side length of each square.

We know `d = 0.025`, so: 
- `8 * s + 7 * 0.025 = 1`
- `8 * s + 0.175 = 1`
- `8 * s = 1 - 0.175`
- `8 * s = 0.825`
- `s = 0.825 / 8`
- `s = `<mark>0.103125</mark>

So, the side length of each individual square is 0.103125 units.

## 3. Determining the "Displacement of Each Square"

When you say "the displacement of each square," in the context of arranging them with a specific gap, this typically refers to the pitch or step size. This is the distance from a reference point on one square (e.g., its left edge or its center) to the same reference point on the next adjacent square along an axis.

This displacement (let's call it `P`) is the sum of the side length of a square (`s`) and the gap size (`d`): `P = s + d` `P = 0.103125 + 0.025` `P = 0.128125`

So, the displacement of each square along either the <mark>X-axis</mark> or <mark>Y-axis</mark> is 0.128125 units.

Y-axis, to maintain the 0.025 gap, is **0.128125** units.

If you were to place the squares by their bottom-left corners, starting at some origin (x0, y0):

- The first square `(0,0)` would be at `(x0, y0)`.
- The next square along X `(1,0)` would be at `(x0 + P, y0)`.
- The square `(i,j)` would have its bottom-left corner at `(x0 + i*P, y0 + j*P)`.

## 4. Regarding "16 Squares in Each Quadrant"

Your statement "This means there should be 16 squares in each quadrant" is consistent with this setup if the 1x1 unit area is centered around an origin (e.g., (0,0)). In that case:

- The 1x1 area would span from -0.5 to +0.5 on both X and Y axes.
- Each quadrant (e.g., top-right from X=0 to 0.5, Y=0 to 0.5) would indeed contain a 4x4 block of your 8x8 grid, which is 16 squares. This detail confirms the density of the packing but doesn't change the calculation of the side length `s` or the pitch `P`.

## In summary:

Side length of each square (`s`): **0.103125 units**
The displacement (pitch or step) of each square along X or Y to maintain the 0.025 gap (`s + d`): **0.128125 units**
