# Description
Note: most of the early examples are broken as the framework changed over time and I haven't fixed yet.

Top to bottom list level of progression and/or complexity.
- basic_window (nothing but glfw)
- basic_triangle (extends by adding basic concepts of OpengGL)
- basic_app (adds and atlas)
- basic_node (integrates Nodes and Nodemanager)
